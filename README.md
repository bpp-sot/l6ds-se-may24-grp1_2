# SOFTWARE ENGINEERING, May 2025 term: 
# Webinar demo and extra resources
This repository is for the Data Science, SOFTWARE ENGINEERING module, specifically the May24 cohort (groups 1 and 2).
Here you will find copies of any additional demo files/programs and resources used in the webinar sessions, and other helpful stuff too.
Remember that your assessment, submission areas and all core e-learning and practical python files are located on THE HUB as usual - this repository is just for supplementary bits!
