# Python Essentials Tutorial

## Introduction (5 minutes)
- Welcome students to the Python Essentials tutorial
- Briefly explain the importance of Python in data science and software development
- Outline the learning objectives for this session

## 1. Control Structures (25 minutes)

### 1.1 If-Else Statements (10 minutes)
- Explain the concept of conditional execution
- Demonstrate basic if-else syntax
- Live coding: Create a simple program that uses if-else to categorise numbers as positive, negative, or zero

### 1.2 Loops (15 minutes)
- Introduce for loops and while loops
- Explain when to use each type of loop
- Live coding: Create a program that uses a for loop to iterate through a list of numbers and calculate their sum
- Live coding: Create a program that uses a while loop to implement a simple guessing game

## 2. Data Structures (30 minutes)

### 2.1 Lists (15 minutes)
- Explain what lists are and why they're useful
- Demonstrate list creation, indexing, and common methods (append, pop, etc.)
- Live coding: Create a program that manages a to-do list using a Python list

### 2.2 Dictionaries (15 minutes)
- Introduce dictionaries as key-value pairs
- Explain when to use dictionaries instead of lists
- Demonstrate dictionary creation, accessing values, and common methods
- Live coding: Create a program that stores and retrieves student grades using a dictionary

## 3. Functions (20 minutes)
- Explain the concept of functions and why they're important for code organisation
- Demonstrate function definition and calling
- Explain parameters and return values
- Live coding: Refactor the earlier sum calculation into a reusable function

## 4. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Basics (30 minutes)
- Introduce the concept of classes and objects
- Explain attributes and methods
- Demonstrate creating a simple class
- Live coding: Create a `BankAccount` class with methods for deposit, withdrawal, and balance checking

## Conclusion and Q&A (10 minutes)
- Recap the key points covered in the tutorial
- Address any questions from students
- Provide resources for further learning and practice

## Practice Exercises
1. Create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list containing only the even numbers.
2. Implement a `Rectangle` class with attributes for width and height, and methods to calculate area and perimeter.
3. Write a program that reads a text file and counts the occurrence of each word, storing the results in a dictionary.
